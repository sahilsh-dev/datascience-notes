The Hadoop ecosystem comprises tools for distributed storage, resource management, data querying, and data ingestion. 
[[HDFS]] provides distributed storage, [[YARN]] manages computational resources, [[Apache Hive]] facilitates SQL-like queries on Big Data, and [[Apache Sqoop]] bridges Hadoop and relational databases.

Each tool addresses a specific Big Data challenge:
- HDFS: Storage.
- YARN: Resource Management.
- Hive: Querying.
- Sqoop: Data Transfer.

A typical workflow includes data ingestion with Sqoop, storage in HDFS, processing with Hive, and resource management via YARN.
