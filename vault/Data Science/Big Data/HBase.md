Apache HBase is a distributed, column-oriented database built on top of Hadoop. Inspired by **Google Bigtable**, it supports real-time read/write access to large datasets, making it ideal for transactional applications.

It is an open source, NoSQL, distributed database developed by Apache software foundation written in Java. HBase is an essential part of our Hadoop ecosystem. HBase runs on top of [[HDFS]] (Hadoop Distributed File System). 

It can store massive amounts of data from terabytes to petabytes. It is column oriented and horizontally scalable. 

## Features of HBase

Key features of HBase include:

Scalability: Can handle petabytes of data.
Real-time Capabilities: Low-latency access.
Fault Tolerance: Ensures data durability and consistency.
Integration: Works well with other Hadoop ecosystem tools.

## RDBMS vs HBase

- RDBMS is mostly Row Oriented whereas HBase is Column Oriented. 
- RDBMS has fixed schema but in HBase we can scale or add columns in run time also. 
- RDBMS is good for structured data whereas HBase is good for semi-structured data. 
- RDBMS is optimized for joins but HBase is not optimized for joins. 

## Applications

- Real-time analytics: HBase is an excellent choice for real-time analytics applications that require low-latency data access.
- Social media applications: HBase is an ideal database for social media applications that require high scalability and performance.
- IoT applications: HBase can be used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that require storing and processing large volumes of sensor data.
- Online transaction processing: HBase can be used as an online transaction processing (OLTP) database, providing high availability, consistency, and low-latency data access.
- Ad serving and clickstream analysis: HBase can be used to store and process large volumes of clickstream data for ad serving and clickstream analysis.
