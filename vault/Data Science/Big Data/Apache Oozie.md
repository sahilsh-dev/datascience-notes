Apache Oozie is a workflow scheduler for managing Hadoop jobs. It helps coordinate and automate complex job dependencies in Hadoop environments, ensuring efficient and timely execution of tasks.

## Features of Apache Oozie

Workflow Automation: Supports sequential and conditional workflows.
Extensibility: Works with custom actions and scripts.
Integration: Interoperates with Pig, Hive, HDFS, and MapReduce.
Scheduling: Includes time and data-triggered workflows.

## Use Cases

- Oozie is particularly effective in orchestrating ETL workflows, managing interdependent jobs, and scheduling periodic data processing tasks. Its automation capabilities streamline operations in data-intensive environments.
- Oozie detects completion of tasks through callback and polling. When Oozie starts a task, it provides a unique callback HTTP URL to the task, and notifies that URL when it is complete. If the task fails to invoke the callback URL, Oozie can poll the task for completion.
- One of the main advantages of Oozie is that it is tightly integrated with Hadoop stack supporting various Hadoop jobs like Hive, Pig, Sqoop as well as system-specific jobs like Java and Shell.

Following three types of jobs are common in Oozie :

**Oozie Workflow Jobs :** These are represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to specify a sequence of actions to be executed.
**Oozie Coordinator Jobs :** These consist of workflow jobs triggered by time and data availability.
**Oozie Bundle :** These can be referred to as a package of multiple coordinator and workflow jobs.
