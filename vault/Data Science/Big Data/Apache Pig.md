## Overview

Apache Pig is a high-level platform for creating MapReduce programs used in Hadoop. 

Its scripting language, Pig Latin, simplifies data processing tasks, making it accessible to non-programmers. 

Pig is particularly adept at ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks and analyzing semi-structured data.

> Pig is often used in scenarios requiring rapid prototyping of data pipelines, analysing logs, and processing large datasets for machine learning. Its flexibility ensures quick turnaround times for data transformations.
