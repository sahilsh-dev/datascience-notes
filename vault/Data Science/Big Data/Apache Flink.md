Apache Flink: Apache Flink is an open-source stream processing framework for distributed, high-performance data processing. 
Designed to handle batch and stream data, Flink offers low-latency, scalable, and fault-tolerant capabilities. Its versatile programming model and ability to process unbounded data streams make it a cornerstone in modern big data architectures.

In big data, Flink enables real-time analytics, event-driven applications, and batch processing at scale. Its distributed nature ensures efficient handling of vast data volumes, while its support for stateful computation allows users to build advanced analytics and machine learning models in real-time.

## Key Features of Flink

Unified Processing: Handles both batch and streaming data seamlessly.
Event Time Processing: Supports event-time semantics with watermarks for precise time-based operations.
Fault Tolerance: Implements state snapshots and recovery using distributed checkpoints.
High Throughput, Low Latency: Processes millions of events per second with minimal delays.
Scalability: Adapts to large-scale data with horizontal scaling.

## Architecture

Flink's architecture consists of a **Job Manager and multiple Task Managers.** The Job Manager coordinates execution, schedules tasks, and monitors progress. 

Task Managers execute the assigned tasks, manage local state, and communicate with other nodes. The architecture supports distributed, parallel computation with fault-tolerant state management
