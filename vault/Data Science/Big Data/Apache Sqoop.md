Sqoop (SQL-to-Hadoop) is a tool for transferring data between Hadoop and relational databases. It supports importing data into HDFS or Hive and exporting processed data back to databases.
Sqoop uses [[MapReduce]] for parallel data transfer, ensuring efficient import and export. It connects to databases through JDBC, ensuring compatibility with popular database systems.

## Features

- Bi-directional data transfer.
- Support for bulk imports and exports.
- Integration with HDFS, Hive, and HBase.
- Incremental data import.
- Uses the `sqoop import` and `sqoop export` commands to import and export data

## Sqoop vs Hive

- **Sqoop**:
    - **Purpose**: Sqoop is designed for **data transfer** between relational databases (like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL) and Hadoop (HDFS or Hive).
    - **Functionality**: It allows you to import data from relational databases into Hadoop (HDFS or Hive) and export data from Hadoop back to relational databases.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for moving large volumes of structured data between Hadoop and relational databases.
- **Hive**:
    - **Purpose**: Hive is a **data warehousing and SQL-like querying tool** built on top of Hadoop.
    - **Functionality**: It provides a SQL-like interface (HiveQL) to query and analyze large datasets stored in Hadoop (HDFS). It translates HiveQL queries into MapReduce, Tez, or Spark jobs for execution.
    - **Use Case**: Ideal for querying and analyzing large datasets using SQL-like syntax, especially for users familiar with SQL.
