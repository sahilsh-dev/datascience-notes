# Advanctages

- Using Apache Flume we can store the data in to any of the centralized stores ([[HDFS]], [[HBase]]).
- When the rate of incoming data exceeds the rate at which data can be written to the destination, Flume acts as a mediator between data producers and the centralized stores and provides a steady flow of data between them by buffering the data in channels to prevent overwhelming the storage system.
- Flume provides the feature ofÂ **contextual routing**. This allows it to send different types of data to different destinations efficiently (based on things like context).
- The transactions in Flume are channel-based where two transactions (one sender and one receiver) are maintained for each message. It guarantees reliable message delivery.
- Flume is reliable, fault tolerant, scalable, manageable, and customizable.
