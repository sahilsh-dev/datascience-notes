Big Data refers to extremely large datasets that are too complex and massive for traditional data-processing software to handle effectively.
These datasets come from a vareity of sources, such as social media platforms, sensor networks, online transaction, and scientific, and are characterized by their volume, velocity, variety and more.

## 5 V's of Big Data

1. **[[Volume]]**
	- Refers to the sheer size of the data being generaetd and stored.
	- Examples: Petabytes of data from social media, IoT devices, or transaction logs.
2.  **[[Velocity]]**
	- Represents the speed at which data is generated, collected, and processed.
	- Examples: Real-time data from stock markets or live video feeds.
3. **[[Variety]]**
	- Encompasses the different formats and types of data.
	- Examples: Structured data (databases), unstructured data (images, videos), and semi-structured data (JSON files).
4. **[[Veracity]]**
	- Refers to the **quality** and **accuracy** of the data, addressing issues like bias, noise, and inconsistencies.
	- Examples: Misinformation on social media or inaccurate sensor readings.
5. **[[Value]]**
	- Highlights the importance of extracting meaningful insights and actionable information from the data
	- Examples: Predictive analytics for customer behaviour or risk assessment in finance
